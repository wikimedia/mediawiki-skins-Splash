Libertinus fonts
================

![Sample of Libertinus fonts](preview.svg)

The Libertinus fonts project is a fork of the [Linux Libertine][1] and Linux
Biolinum fonts.  It started as an OpenType math companion of the Libertine font
family, and has grown to a full fork to address some of the bugs in the fonts.
Thanks to Frédéric Wang for coming up with the name Libertinus.

Libertinus was forked from the [5.3.0 (2012-07-02) release][2] of Linux
Libertine fonts.

The family consists of:

* Libertinus Serif: forked from *Linux Libertine*.
* Libertinus Sans: forked from *Linux Biolinum*.
* Libertinus Mono: forked from *Linux Libertine Mono*.
* Libertinus Math: an OpenType math font for use in OpenType math-capable
  applications (like LuaTeX, XeTeX or MS Word 2007+).

Libertinus fonts are available under the terms of the Open Font License version
1.1.

A zip file containing the font files can be downloaded from the “[Releases][3]”
page of the project on GitHub.

See the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) file
for instructions on how to build the fonts and contribute any changes.
